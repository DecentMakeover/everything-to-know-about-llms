## NLP Foundations â€” Index

This section is split into focused folders for clarity:

- Embeddings and Tokenization: `embeddings/README.md`
- Sequence Models (pre-Transformer): `sequence-models/README.md`
- Transformers and LLMs: `transformers/README.md`

Start with embeddings and tokenization, then sequence models, then move to transformers and LLMs.
